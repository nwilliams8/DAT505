This project is a city model loading using obj and mtl loader, the user can interact with the model using the dat gui menu in the right upper hand of the 
window where they can change the background, time of day, toggle the rain and level of light as well as the wind speed.
I have aimed for a simplistic texturing method for the city by applying sharp bold colours to the buildings to make each one stand out individually.
To make the model I used blender and exported it into an obj file for the model and an mtl for the textures, I also made the clouds in blender however due to some 
issues with the toggle switch with dat.gui I imported it in a different way and used an image texture. I wanted to include some elements to make the project feel a bit denser 
with detail so I started adding elements to the buildings such as external fire escapes, various air conditioners, dumpsters and electrical boxes.
