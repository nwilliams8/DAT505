This project is a city model loading using obj and mtl loader, the user can interact with the model using the dat gui menu in the right upper hand of the window where they can change the background, time of day, toggle the rain and level of light as well as the wind speed.I have aimed for a simplistic texturing method for the city by applying sharp bold colours to the buildings to make each one stand out individually, this combined with the antialias option on the webgl renderer make for smooth and clear textures.To make the model I used blender and exported it into an obj file for the model and an mtl for the textures, I also made the clouds in blender however due to some issues with the toggle switch with dat.gui I imported it in a different way and used an image texture. I wanted to include some elements to make the project feel a bit denser with detail so I started adding elements to the buildings such as external fire escapes, various air conditioners, dumpsters and electrical boxes. 

To explore this project you can use the orbit controls which operate as follows: hold click and move the mouse to rotate the model, hold right click and move the mouse to pan across the model and scroll the mouse to zoom in and out of the model. You can also use the dat gui menu, as mentioned earlier, to change the conditions surrounding the city model.
